# My professional portfolio

Hi! My name is Xurxe and this my first professional portfolio. Learning to code as I go along :)
Please note that the site is still very incomplete!

## Demo

For now you can find the work-in-progress here: https://xurxe.github.io/portfolio/
Once the site is complete, I'll host it in my own domain.
